# üå´Ô∏è ESP8266 Air Quality & Environment Monitor with BME280 & MQ-135

This project is a smart air quality and environment monitoring system based on the **NodeMCU ESP8266**, utilizing the **MQ-135** gas sensor and **BME280** for temperature, humidity, pressure, and altitude readings. It integrates with **Blynk IoT Platform** for real-time remote monitoring and status updates.

## üì¶ Features

- Reads and compensates **air quality (CO2 estimate)** based on MQ-135 sensor.
- Measures **temperature**, **humidity**, **barometric pressure**, and **altitude** using BME280.
- **Night mode LED control** to avoid disturbances during sleep.
- **WiFi and Blynk auto-reconnect logic** for robust uptime.
- Real-time updates to the **Blynk app dashboard**.
- Visual LED alerts:
  - Blinks on sensor failure.
  - Solid light on poor air quality.
- Virtual button to **manually trigger data upload** from Blynk app.

## üß∞ Hardware Requirements

| Component             | Description                            |
|----------------------|----------------------------------------|
| NodeMCU ESP8266      | Wi-Fi enabled microcontroller board     |
| MQ-135 Gas Sensor    | For air quality (CO2, NH3, etc.)        |
| BME280 Sensor        | For temperature, humidity, pressure     |
| Breadboard & Wires   | For prototyping connections             |
| Power Supply         | USB or external 5V                      |

> **Note:** BME280 uses I2C by default (SDA = D2, SCL = D1 on NodeMCU).
